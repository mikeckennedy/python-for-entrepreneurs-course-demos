 0:04 Over the next couple of videos, 
0:07 we are going to talk about choosing a Python web framework 
0:10 and which one we are going to use for this course. 
0:13 Let's start by answering the question what can you build with Python? 
0:17 Well, it turns out there are a bunch of amazing products and companies 
0:21 that you all use and are familiar with, built with Python. 
0:24 Let's look at a few of the use cases. 
0:27 The Onion, the hilarious fake news organization, 
0:30 their web application is built in Python
0:33 Spotify is also using Python for their web front end
0:36 Nasa- rockets and spaceships and all sorts of amazing stuff, they are using Python
0:41 bitly the short link app is built with Python.
0:44 Bitbucket, Atlassian’s competitor to github is built with Python, that's very nice
0:50 Survey Monkey they use Python all over the place
0:53 Quora, the best general Q&A spot on the internet, 
0:57 they are passionate, passionate users of Python, 
1:00 not only do they use Python for most of their app and their web front end, 
1:04 you'll see them right frequently looking inside their engineering organization 
1:08 talking about the challenges and how they solve them in Python and so on. 
1:11 Disqus, one of the most popular comment add ins for your web site
1:16 so if you have a blog or say a podcast, and you want to have comments at the end, 
1:21 you can have this nice live pushed based comment section 
1:24 right at the bottom of your pages and that's largely done with Python, 
1:27 not 100% but much of it. 
1:29 Instagram uses Python in a lot of places. 
1:32 Reddit, Reddit is a major user of Python for their website 
1:35 as well as SQLAlchemy for their database
1:38 YouTube was built with Python
1:41 Pinterest built their website with Python
1:43 PayPal is a massive user of Python, you'll see throughout their whole company
1:46 they are doing many interesting things with Python
1:49 they are blogging and writing about what they are doing with Python
1:52 one of their services that does pricings for the exchange rate 
1:55 where they charge you some small percent for a transaction throughout the day
1:59 that service that answers that question 
2:01 what percent do people have to pay 
2:03 or what should PayPal charge you, throughout the day,
2:06 that service is written in Python and handles several billion requests per day, 
2:11 and is running down around the millisecond response time.
2:14 Dropbox maybe one of the biggest users of Python
2:17 most of the backend stuff happening at the company at the server side 
2:21 at Dropbox is happening in Python. 
2:24 The client stuff side, the little box that does the sinking 
2:27 and the app that runs on your machine also Python interestingly, 
2:30 so you'll see that Dropbox is a major user of Python 
2:33 and some of the Python core developers as well as Guido Van Rossum, 
2:37 the creator of Python himself, work there. 
2:40 So Dropbox is a heavy user of Python and an absolute hotbed of it. 
2:44 And finally, Talk Python, my websites, my podcast, my training site, 
2:48 all run on Python and we are going to be of course looking 
2:52 inside the code that does that. 
2:54 If you'd like to see where this information came from, 
2:57 read a little bit more about how each company or product is using Python, 
2:59 you can just check out this bitly url down here at the bottom, 
3:02 and there is a nice write up featuring these companies as well as more.
