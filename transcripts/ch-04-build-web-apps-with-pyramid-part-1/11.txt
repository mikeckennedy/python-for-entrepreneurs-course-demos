 0:02 Let's talk about the building blocks 
0:05 that you are going to use to build your application when you are using Pyramid. 
0:08 The first thing that we want to do is take a request from the outside world 
0:12 and somehow map this into our application and that all begins with routes, 
0:16 routes are url patterns that we then map into particular view methods, 
0:20 speaking of views, these are the methods 
0:23 that are going to process our request,
0:24 whether they show us an html page through rendering a template 
0:29 or make some kind of update to a database and do a redirect, 
0:31 that's where we are going to do it, is it in these view methods. 
0:35 And note that in mvc these are called controllers. 
0:40 Next, we are going to talk about templates, 
0:42 typically what we'll do with our views is we'll come up with some sort of data 
0:45 and then we'll pass that off to a dynamic template 
0:48 and this template is going to take that data 
0:51 and turn it into html that actually goes back to the user. 
0:54 The thing that flows between the views and the templates are called models, 
0:59 and these are basically dictionaries in Python 
1:01 and this is both data and behavior that we can pass to the view. 
1:06 Pyramid has rich support for static assets,
1:09 so images, cascading style sheets, Javascript 
1:13 and more will be able to manage those separately 
1:16 more or less offloading the request out of our web app 
1:19 and passing it just to the web server itself.
1:22 We also want to work with configuration files, 
1:25 you want to put your API keys and other sorts of information like that 
1:28 into the configuration files and these are often different between dev tests and prod.
