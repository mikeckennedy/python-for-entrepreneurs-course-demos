0:02 It's time to get started. Let's create our Pyramid web app.
0:05 So, the steps to do that look like this- 
0:08 we are going to start out and create a virtual environment, 
0:10 technically this step is optional
0:13 but virtual environments help us understand 
0:15 what packages are in play for a particular application 
0:17 which means where you have a better understanding 
0:20 of what we need to push out to production when we actually deploy our application.
0:23 I find this helpful, it's up to you, you can skip this step if you want. 
0:26 Then we are going to install the Pyramid package and all of its dependencies 
0:31 which will happen automatically.
0:35 Pyramid comes with scaffolding, and what that means is 
0:38 there is a lot of moving parts to the website you got your css, 
0:41 your Javascript, your static folders, your views, it has unit tests, 
0:44 it itself is a Python package, so it has some files associated with that 
0:49 and while you can of course create all these yourself, 
0:52 it's completely non productive 
0:54 and so there are four different kinds of starter applications we can create 
0:57 using this scaffolding, 
0:59 so after we've installed Pyramid we are going to give our application a jumpstart 
1:02 by choosing one of the scaffolding starter sites to begin with. 
1:06 Pyramid is a little unique in that the website 
1:09 that gets created is itself a Python package, 
1:12 and so that means there is a simple step we have to run 
1:15 to register that package with the Python runtime 
1:18 or environment that we are working in, 
1:20 so if we are creating in a virtual environment register it there 
1:22 for doing it in a global one on our machine register it there, 
1:26 so it knows how to find its views and its startup code and all that kind of stuff. 
1:30 We'd run our app, we serve it up, we add our features and of course, 
1:33 we go back around and we just iteratively develop it 
1:36 until we have our app ready for deployment. 
1:39 Now, how do you want to get started? 
1:42 We could use the IDE PyCharm, click a few buttons and create our web application, 
1:46 or we could go the command line route 
1:48 and run a couple of commands in the terminal, and create our application. 
1:52 We are actually going to go through both ways, PyCharm is simpler, 
1:56 but I think you don't get to see all the moving parts 
1:59 so maybe there might be a step or two that you don't totally understand, 
2:02 so let's go through the command line version first, 
2:06 see all the steps involved and then if you have PyCharm professional, 
2:09 you can click a few buttons and create a website straight away, 
2:12 if you have PyCharm community edition or another one, 
2:15 you want to follow along with the CLI version.
