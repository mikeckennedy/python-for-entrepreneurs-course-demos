 00:01 Now that we've downloaded and installed Git,
00:04 we just need to perform a few first time setup commands,
00:07 in order to get things up and running.
00:09 Now you only need to run these commands once,
00:12 so just keep that in mind, you don't need to do this every time you start out Git.
00:15 Back in the terminal, we can now work with Git.
00:18 Let's run our first set of commands,
00:21 now we are going to use the Git config command, there is a whole lot of options here,
00:24 we are really just going to run four commands. 
00:27 The first thing we want to do is set up our username,
00:31 this is how it is going to identify us, who we are, this is our natural name. 
00:35 So we'll type Git config and we'll give it the global,
00:40 we're saying we're setting this up for all of Git on our system, 
00:43 not just for a single project.
00:46 So git config --global user.name 
00:49 and I am just going to give it my normal human name, Matt Makai. 
00:55 Now if you don't get any output back that's good, 
00:58 that means that everything went smoothly.
01:01 With the next command, we are going to set up our user email address, 
01:04 now this is super helpful when for example we commit code 
01:08 and we are working on a large project, we are working on an open source project, 
01:11 maybe with people we don't necessarily know 
01:14 and then they need to get in contact with us. 
01:17 Now on our own businesses that may not be a big deal, 
01:20 but if you hire contractors you are going to want to know 
01:23 who you should contact in case anything goes wrong. 
01:26 So for this we are going to say git config -- global again user 
01:29 and instead of name we are going to say user.email. 
01:32 And in my case, this is just matthew.makai@gmail.com. 
01:37 Now again, no output is good, that means it's saved properly. 
01:41 And we'll check it in just a moment;
01:44 now the third thing we want to run and this is optional, 
01:47 but I always set this, I set my editor, 
01:50 now by default, typically Nano is the editor that pops up but I use Vim. 
01:55 And again, if you are using Sublime Text what you can do on your own system is 
01:59 set the path to the executable so a little pop up with the Sublime Text editor 
02:03 whenever you need to commit some text 
02:07 or you need to write some text that Git will interpret.
02:11 We'll get into that a little bit later, but for right now, 
02:14 we can set this up by saying Git config again global core.editor, 
02:18 and in my case again, I am going to press specify Vim. 
02:22 Okay, so we've got our three things set, 
02:25 we just want to double check that we've set them properly, 
02:28 we can say git config and then just list out. 
02:31 Now in my case, user.name is Matt Makai, 
02:35 user.email is matthew.makai@gmail.com, and my core editor is Vim. 
02:41 Obviously your setting is going to be depending upon what you set, 
02:44 and again if it's a little bit confusing at this point, you don't have to worry about the editor,
02:48 but you should go ahead and set user.name and user.email. 
02:51 With those few settings out of the way, 
02:53 we're ready to get started and dive into using Git.
