0:02 There are few things over here that were not so smooth. 
0:05 For one you saw me forget to do this because in my web apps 
0:08 I don't ever have these initializers on the top level controllers, 
0:11 but also this built cache id stuff, this is not so great, 
0:16 so let's see how we can use a base controller to make all these shared pieces 
0:21 you can see everyone is going to need to have the request, 
0:23 it's going to have this initializer, 
0:25 we are going to want to use this built cache id all over the place 
0:28 and as this complexity in features of our app grow, 
0:31 that requirement to share all these things is going to absolutely grow as well. 
0:35 So what we are going to do is we are going to add a base controller. 
0:44 Like so, and all it's going to do is have the various common pieces 
0:48 so we are going to start up by moving this down here like so 
0:54 and then inheriting from base controller
1:00 PyCharm import it you can see it's added the import line up here and, 
1:04 this built cache id thing let's move this around, 
1:07 so we can go down here and say self.built cache id 
1:11 so we are going to set basically field here that is this implementation, 
1:17 like so, and we need to import this like we did above, 
1:23 here is our static cache utility method that we are going to put here, 
1:25 we could actually take and move the implementation down here 
1:27 but I am not a big fan of doing that. 
1:30 So now we can come up here and delete this, make this much simpler 
1:37 and do it similarly for these others, now when I run this, 
1:41 it's not going to work quite as well as you would think, 
1:43 it's going to be missing the built cache id 
1:46 because of the way we are expressing it in the templates. 
1:50 See this name error build cache id, it turns out before we were passing in the model 
1:54 and now we have associated it with the underlined view, but that's no problem, 
1:58 we just need to make a small tweak.
2:01 Let's go over here, we can do a replace, we'll replace this with view.this 
2:08 so because we are storing it on the controller 
2:12 it's now considered to be part of the view, 
2:14 remember the way the nomenclature pyramid is, controller is a view basically. 
2:18 So if I do this and I say replace all there I have replaced in all of them
2:23 let's just look at this one, so now anytime we want to use our cache id 
2:26 we'll just come here and say view.build_cache_id 
2:29 now let's try this again, perfect, everything is back the way we wanted it, 
2:34 but we have a much simpler normal controllers, 
2:38 here you can see we just have the action decorator to set the template, 
2:42 and then we just return a basic model, 
2:45 whatever is special about this method 
2:48 and the base controller handles the initialization, 
2:50 it's going to handle common layout, 
2:52 it's handling these other utility features that we need, 
2:56 like this static cache id utility and so on, 
2:58 So, like I said, as your app grows this base controller is going to be the place 
3:02 where your common shared functionality lives, 
3:05 and it's going to keep your normal methods you write much simpler 
3:08 and make the maintenance of your app across various action methods 
3:13 and controllers much simpler.
