0:02 So let's create our first handler, or like I said, 
0:06 I am going to be calling them from now on controllers. 
0:09 And notice I have hacked up the my template page 
0:11 and let's just run the site real quick to see what things look like here. 
0:15 Ok, I threw away all that starter stuff 
0:17 and now we just have a really simple 3. navigation 
0:20 and a basically something that tells us which page we're on. 
0:25 So this is not handlers yet, this is just me tweaking the template,
0:28 down here this run but his, view here. 
0:32 Now because we are building professional long live large web applications, 
0:36 we want to add a little more structure than just hey here is a single file
0:40 that contains a ton of stuff in it, that's not great as this thing grows,
0:44 so first thing we are going to do is we are going to create a little more structure here 
0:47 so we are going to go over here and we are going to create a directory called controllers, 
0:53 and then in the templates, we are going to create 
0:56 a grouping of template files for each controller file. 
1:00 So let's go over here, create a file, I'll call this home controller, 
1:06 because I want to build a home controller class, 
1:08 and for each controller, whatever the prefix name is here
1:11 I am going to put a folder in here now I have one called home,
1:16 later, we are going to need one for say albums, 
1:24 so we are going to use that part of the name down here as well. 
1:29 Ok, so you can see there is going to be an each controller a number maybe 4, 5 ,10 
1:34 who knows it depends on how complicated it is, 
1:37 a number of action methods each action method 
1:40 typically has a corresponding template, 
1:42 so let's copy that and paste it over here and call this index, 
1:45 what we are going to do for our method is 
1:48 we are going to have three methods here, index, about and contact, 
1:53 so let's just go over here make those, there is contol c contorl
2:00 great and then let's quickly fix these up 
2:04 so we actually know which page we are on this is going to be the contact page, 
2:07 the contents of it aren't super important, 
2:10 maybe we can pass a single piece of information here let's just say 
2:14 maybe we'll just do something like this where we pass in some value, who knows. 
2:19 Just to show that each action method is actually doing something different. 
2:24 Great, so we have our index, about and contact. 
2:28 Let's go and add the controllers. 
2:31 So recall, the first thing we've got to do is import pyramid handlers, 
2:37 now, PyCharms this out saying 
2:39 hey you are not really using this yet, no not yet, but we will. 
2:43 The name of this class is basically immaterial, 
2:47 we just need to use it when we do the mapping but just for me 
2:51 I like to have it the name of the grouping, controller 
2:55 and so that's how I am going to call this, and then we are going to add three methods, 
2:58 we are going to have a def index, for now I'll just say pass 
3:01 and then we'll do this for about and we'll do it for contact. 
3:04 Do a little format, great, ok so remember, what we need to return here is a dictionary. 
3:10 And we also need to tell the index about and contact methods 
3:14 what template they should use to render that dictionary, 
3:19 so we'll say Pyramid handlers.action and we'll say render = it's going to be
3:25 templates/home/ this one is going to be index.pt.
3:33 And about, contact. maybe some day I'll come up with 
3:40 some alternate implementation here
3:43 that when you call these functions if it doesn't have a render, 
3:45 it looks for you know, something like in this pattern, but right now, 
3:48 you have to explicitly say this. 
3:51 So let's try go into say like /home/about see what happens. 
3:55 Spoiler alert- it's not going to work. 
3:58 So if I go here you can see 404 not found. 
4:03 Remember, creating the controller is not enough, we also have to map it.
