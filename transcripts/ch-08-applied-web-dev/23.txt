00:03 Everything we've done so far has been data that the users can consume, 
00:06 but they haven't been able to contribute or edit it in even the simplest way. 
00:11 We are going to address that now in the next couple of lectures. 
00:13 So let's start by talking about html forms 
00:16 specifically within the context of Chameleon templates, but also in general. 
00:20 Here is a form and this is a very simple form, 
00:23 what it lets users do is enter their email address and their password 
00:26 and then log into our website. In our website we are just going to say 
00:29 the email address is the username, keep it simple. 
00:32 So you can see, everything is contained within a form and forms have actions 
00:36 and they have methods so here the action is just double quote 
00:39 which means it's going to submit back to the same page, that render this form, 
00:44 so if the page that rendered it was /accounts/sign in,
00:49 it's going to post back, to that exact same url, and this is usually what you want. 
00:54 It also has a method the method is post, it could be get, 
00:58 it could be some other thing that might limit us in a few ways, 
01:00 typically post is important, post communicates to the server 
01:04 that you don't want to be able to cache this,
01:06 you are possibly altering data things like that. 
01:09 It has a number of input forms as well as a single button, 
01:13 and these input forms have a type so like text and password,
01:17 and they optionally have a value, 
01:19 here we are specifying a value of ${email_address} and ${password} 
01:24 Initially, you can imagine those would be empty.
01:27 But it could be that they submitted this form back to us 
01:30 and they had typed in an email address 
01:32 and there are some kind of reason they couldn't log in, 
01:34 but we'd like to preserve that data that they have submitted to us for multiple round trips. 
01:39 So we can do that by refilling, 
01:41 repopulating the input fields with whatever data they had entered.
