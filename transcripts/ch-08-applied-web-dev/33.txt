 00:02 We've seen how valuable view models can be for validation. 
00:05 Let's look at this a little more deeply. 
00:07 Here we have what I would call a standard view model, 
00:10 we have a view model base, it has a to dictionary, 
00:12 we have the registration view model, it has a __init__ it sets the fields, 
00:15 and it has a from dict so it will take in data as well as just return 
00:21 whatever data you set to the view.
00:24 If we are going to convert this to one that also supports validations, 
00:26 there is two simple steps we have to do;
00:29 first, we need to round trip some kind of error message 
00:33 so we are going to create a self.error,
00:35 and in the beginning, everybody starts out pure, 
00:37 there is no errors, there is nothing wrong here. 
00:40 However, we do want to have the ability to add some rules, 
00:44 potentially set some errors, so we do that by adding a compute errors function, 
00:48 now the way it works is we create one of these view models, 
00:51 we say from dict and then we call compute errors and if something goes wrong, 
00:54 it's going to set the error message, then in our action, 
00:57 we can check and see if there is an error, there is no error, 
00:59 everything was good, the validation passed, 
01:02 if there was well maybe we want to stop.
01:04 we could also return some kind of boolean expression from here 
01:06 but since we are going to need the error message 
01:08 anyway to do anything useful in the form we might as well just use that.
