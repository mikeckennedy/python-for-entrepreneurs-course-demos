00:02 These controllers through Pyramid handlers are awesome, 
00:05 and they really make working with your code and organizing it super easy, 
00:10 but one of the challenges you run into in this nice and easy routing that we've set up, 
00:14 this pattern matching we've set up is methods
00:18 that are not necessarily intended to be public, 
00:20 can become externally callable via some url. 
00:25 So in this example we've got something that is meant to be mapped to your url 
00:29 the index and you can see it checks and says if there is no data 
00:32 we are going to reset the data and then we are going to do something else. 
00:35 Now maybe that reset data has consequences 
00:37 you don't want people to be able to mess with, 
00:40 and because we've written good, small organized code we have this broken 
00:46 into different functions, and things like that, but because it is a function, 
00:49 on a controller class, it is executable by default 
00:53 we probably don't want that 
00:55 so imagine what we would get if we went to /server/home/reset_data 
01:00 maybe it's fine but maybe it's not and if it's not what do you do about it?
01:03 Well, you saw that we can create this suppress decorator, 
01:06 it's also an action decorator, it just happens to change 
01:09 the target request method in http. 
01:12 So basically we tell Pyramid handlers look, this function should only be called 
01:16 if the browser sends a not an http verb type request, instead of get post and so on, 
01:23 let me just put that at suppress onto the various methods 
01:27 we want to basically make inaccessible by using the invalid http verb.
01:31 Now we can safely put these methods on our controller classes 
01:34 and we won't be concerned about them possibly getting called inappropriately.
