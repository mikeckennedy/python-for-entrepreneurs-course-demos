 0:02 Are you excited? I know that I am. 
0:05 We have reached the chapter where we dig in and really build our web application. 
0:10 We are going to focus on all the stuff you need to build a data driven web app 
0:14 now that you have all the foundational stuff in place. 
0:17 We are going to start with something called handlers. Pyramid handlers. 
0:21 Now, these are not super well known features of Pyramid 
0:25 or extension of Pyramid really is the way to think of it, it's a separate PyPi package. 
0:30 But, they allow us to do simpler routing and more importantly, 
0:35 they provide what I would consider universal access to core features. 
0:39 If for some reason we want to be able to access the user in a certain way, 
0:45 or a particular cookie like an authentication cookie, 
0:48 various places where we are processing the request,
0:51 remember in a real web app you have like a hundred, 
0:54 two hundred methods that are actually handling these requests 
0:57 talking to the database and doing things, 
0:59 and the right level of separation is really important handlers facilitate that, 
1:02 in a really interesting and powerful way, and they are quite easy to use, 
1:05 I think you'll find them of nice edition. 
1:08 We are also going to look more carefully at the Chameleon templates, 
1:11 so we haven't done a whole lot with these templates other than sort of poke at them 
1:15 and say that they exist, but we are really going to look at them 
1:19 and use them to build a website we are going to go and take real data 
1:23 and pass it onto the templates and do interesting things with it. 
1:26 We are also going to stop making copies of our website design
1:30 what we've done so far is we sort of copied pieces around 
1:33 and poked it at saying look we'll address this later, 
1:36 we are now going to address this concept of a shared layout, 
1:39 we are going to do this through a mechanism inside of Chameleon called Macros 
1:44 and you'll see that we have a single layout page that defines 
1:47 basically a hole where the customized content goes for each particular view, 
1:51 and then we are going to put all that stuff, 
1:53 all the css all those sort of wrapper bits of the html in one page, 
1:57 one template and share it across the whole thing. 
2:00 So that means if we want to add a new page it's super easy, we just fill in that hole,
2:04 if, more importantly, if we want to change the look and feel for our site, 
2:08 we just do that in one place and every page in our site 
2:11 automatically adapts to that common look and feel. 
2:15 We are not going to do read only data anymore, 
2:17 we are now going to accept input from users, let them edit things, 
2:20 this can be as simple as letting them log in 
2:23 or letting them register to create an account, 
2:25 but it could get more advanced with 
2:28 some kind of backend admin section that we might build, 
2:31 certainly to do things like input our albums into our web page, 
2:35 we are going to need some kind of admin backend.
2:39 While passing pure dictionaries around is what is required by the template 
2:43 and it's the way Pyramid works, it doesn't mean that that's what we should be doing, 
2:48 we are going to introduce this concept of a view model 
2:51 which is a richer more intelligent class basically that is tied to the template
2:57 that is being displayed and has the validation rules and some of the data access rules
3:02 that we might need in this separate layer. 
3:05 So, when we do this, the action methods, the ones that actually process the request, 
3:09 their job will be much simpler and some of that validation 
3:14 and the complexities of whatever problem we are trying to solve 
3:17 will be moved over into this view model. 
3:19 This will make it easier to maintain and validate our code, 
3:22 but it will also make it easier to test our code 
3:25 because we can work with the validation in these view models 
3:28 not just poking at fake web request. 
3:31 Speaking of validation, we'll see that the view models are an important player 
3:37 in the server side validation, which we are going to need 
3:40 and we are also going to talk about adding client side validation 
3:43 so that most of the time we don't even have to go back to the server
3:46 users get immediate feedback saying what they need to do to properly fill out the form.
3:51 Alright, so that's what's on deck for the chapter, 
3:54 I think you are really going to learn a lot 
3:57 and you are going to be very capable of Pyramid and web development 
4:00 after we get through these topics.
